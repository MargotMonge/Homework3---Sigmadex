1. Introduce the protocol, their product offering and make an evaluation of their company.

SigmadexÂ is an open-source, self-stabilizing, community-driven, and game theory-enhanced liquidity protocol built on Avalanche. It eliminates the requirement for having to trust any intermediaries, prioritizes decentralization, and is governed by the community. It offers 1 product Sigmadex for now and they are working on the second product SigmaFi. With Sigmadex, users can do financial transactions with attracting rates with a large number of tokens of their choices. Its native token is SDEX, token holders can use it to vote on changes or proposals of the protocol, SDEX is also used to mint various NFTs on SigmaFi and can also serve as staking token for earning further SDEX rewards. sSDEX represents the SDEX token locked in the Sigma ecosystem. By separating SDEX and sSDEX they are able to govern and balance the protocol accordingly by having a global perspective on total circulation and ecosystem balance. Sigmadex has a Telegram community of 3 370 subscribers, a Twitter community with 13.9k followers and 937 followers on its Github repository. In Telegram and Twitter, Sigmadex has been updating its progress or information about the market on a regular basis, which can be a good point to notice. However, in Github, there are not many new commits. So we can say that it does relatively well in marketing but are still not known by many people, it does not have more new features since its creation, which was more than 2 years ago. Sigmadex has raised 4.2M dollars on June 2021 of 24 investors. They have 12,000 unique free sSDEX claims made on the Avalanche network. There is no SDEX token on circulation. So the source of funds of Sigmadex is really from the investment. No big amount of new investment has been announced by Sigmadex. So its estimated financial state would not be too easy.

3. Describe a few use cases where the AMM model is useful or optionally, if you have the expertise, some suitable trading strategies.

Because it is a dynamic AMM, Sigmadex is particularly useful in period of volatility, as it has the ability to increase capital efficiency and cluster liquidity close to the market price when volatility is low. Inversely, with high volatility it can expand so traders can be protected from impairment loss.
Besides, like many AMMS one goal of Sigmadex is to make a protocol easy to use by anyone, independent of the background knowledge of the trader in cryptocurrencies. 
To give you more concrete useful cases, Sigmadex is exploiting NFTs in quite a different way as other protocols because they aim to create such that would add value both to the platform and the user experience. Alongside the fundamental protocol, Sigmadex offers unique opportunities for harnessing NFTs. 
Besides, Sigmadex opens up to new datasets because of its use of game theory and core Sigmadex DeFi, which brings new insights that could help make better automatic trading decisions. For instance, you can access heat map to interpret the overall health of a specific asset.
Furthermore, if you wish to become a liquidity provider, Sigmadex could be of interest as it offers in exchange of your liquidity further advantages than just transaction fees. Such can include time locked rewards and bonding rewards.

4. Conclude with some thoughts on your experience of collaborating on Github (what works well, challenges, learnings)

They were challenges with git merge as we are not very comfortable with GitHub interface. Once we got the hang of it, it got smoother but it required several attempts to understand the functioning of branches and git merge.
