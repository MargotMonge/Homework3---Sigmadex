3. Describe a few use cases where the AMM model is useful or optionally, if you have the expertise, some suitable trading strategies

Because it is a dynamic AMM, Sigmadex is particularly useful in period of volatility, as it has the ability to increase capital efficiency and cluster liquidity close to the market price when volatility is low. Inversely, with high volatility it can expand so traders can be protected from impairment loss.
Besides, like many AMMS one goal of Sigmadex is to make a protocol easy to use by anyone, independent of the background knowledge of the trader in cryptocurrencies. 
To give you more concrete useful cases, Sigmadex is exploiting NFTs in quite a different way as other protocols because they aim to create such that would add value both to the platform and the user experience. Alongside the fundamental protocol, Sigmadex offers unique opportunities for harnessing NFTs. 
Besides, Sigmadex opens up to new datasets because of its use of game theory and core Sigmadex DeFi, which brings new insights that could help make better automatic trading decisions. For instance, you can access heat map to interpret the overall health of a specific asset.
Furthermore, if you wish to become a liquidity provider, Sigmadex could be of interest as it offers in exchange of your liquidity further advantages than just transaction fees. Such can include time locked rewards and bonding rewards.
